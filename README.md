## AVA for React Native

This project is the AVA auto-tracking device revised in React Native with tensorflowjs.

At this point in time, it only features detection. We're planning to fully flesh out the App to showcase AVA movement in sync with a TFJS model movement.

AVA is an auto-tracking hardware device that connects to an app via bluetooth and uses computer vision to keep a subject in the middle of the screen. The main project uses a flutter app with Tensorflow Lite (TFLite). In this repo, we are experimenting with TFJS and webBLE.

In order to use this repo, you'll need to own an AVA device. For more detials visit https://ava.website
